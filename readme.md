# CSS tests
This project is an collection of CSS tests that I made while learn CSS.

## Where I learn?
I learn with v√≠deo tutorials of these YouTube channels:
- [Curso em video](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.youtube.com/cursoemvideo)
- [Online Tutorials](https://youtube.com/c/OnlineTutorials4Designers)
- [Tiger Codes](https://youtube.com/c/TigerCodes)
- Others

I so learn with other platforms, but, the YouTube is the most used by me.
